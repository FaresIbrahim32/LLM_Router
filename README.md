this is an llm router agent built with LangGraph and OpenRouter . The user enters a prompt and the prompt gets directed to the best model for that task while also considering cost effectiveness . LangGraph is used as a RAG to scrap documentation from OpenRouter and store it in a ChromaDB , mainly to know which models are free to use for a user. The actual response is generated by OpenRouter's API which instantiates an llm for generation based on the task classification and priority desired from quality , speed , or cost by user . The task classification method is done by finding semantic distances and clustering a prompt under a specific task
